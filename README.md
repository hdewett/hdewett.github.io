Hilora's Website

This is the very first webpage that I coded! I'm currently using it as a portfolio and I'm hoping to update it with more projects soon. The website was designed and coded by Hilora Dewett (that's me ðŸ¤ ) entirely with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

The biggest challenge I've had with this project is not sacrificing my personality for a simpler design. There is A LOT on this web page and I'm doing my best to make it as clean and accessible as I can! There were times that I thought it would be so much simpler just to scrap the funky background, remove the Play Ball game from the homepage, remove the animations, etc., but I am glad that I didn't. I think it's doable to have a fun website that reflects me while maintaining it's accessibility.

What I'm currently working on:
- Responsiveness: 

  - Some items get cut off as the screen gets smaller so I am working on fixing this! It will be mobile-friendly soon.
- Accessibility:

  - I'm currently working through adding alt text to all my images.
  
  - The nav bar has no background which might make it difficult to see on smaller screens. Working on a design that is (fun)ctional. 
- General

  - Working on code clean up and integrating flex box where I can
  - Presenting the "Skills" badges in a manner that is easier to adjust as I learn more
